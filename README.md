# Project 01 - Port Authority

## Premise
    You are in charge of checking cargo at the docks.  Don't let embargoed cargo come through!  Click on any piece of cargo to toggle whether to accept it.  Good cargo adds to your score, but embargoed cargo will subtract from your score!  You have until the end of your shift to finish your cargo backlog, so work quickly!  
  
    A game that tests your recognition skills and speed. 

## Details and Code logic

*Created with javascript, jQuery and Bootstrap  
*When the game starts, the player will recive a not from the trade authority showing which pieces should not be let through.  
*The game board is then populated with different cargo, and the player may flag any number of cargo items to not be allowed through  
*When the player clicks the accept cargo button, the point values of the accepted cargo is tallied, with good cargo adding points and bad cargo subtracting points  
*When the player either completes the cargo log OR the timer runs out, the game will check to see if the player score is greater than or equal to the target score and pull a win/lose result  
*The game resets once the win/lose modal is closed
